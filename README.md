# Zymo Research Transmit: Simple Public Health Data Transmission

We are honored to be playing an important role in the response to COVID-19.  To assist with that, we have chosen to make this program available as free, open-source software for all to use with our support.  Please contact us if you require assistance with this software or other portions of your pipeline ranging from sample collection and preservation to viral RNA extraction, detection, or analysis.  We have experts in high-throughput laboratory automation ready to help you scale-up as well.

     Be quick, but don't hurry.
                                 â€“ John Wooden

At Zymo Research, our vision is, "*To have a positive impact in the biomedical field and to contribute to the greater good of humanity*," and it is with this vision guiding our efforts that we offer you this software package.


#### Publication
At present, there is not publication planned for this software.  If anybody in the public health/epidemiology field wishes to collaborate on one, please contact us.  We love to publish.

## Quick Start Guide
This Program was written in Python 3.6.4.  It should work with other version of 3.6 and most likely later versions as well.
Earlier versions may have some difficulties. Please report any compatibility problems you may have and I will see about addressing them if you really must run on a different version of Python.

If you do not already have the Python language installed on your computer, you can download the web-based installer from this page on [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/) or directly from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4-amd64-webinstall.exe) on a Windows computer.  **During Python installation, be sure to enable Python in your PATH variables, as that will make this program much easier to run in the future.  Also be sure to approve installation of Tcl/Tk and PIP, as those will also contribute to making this easier to run in the future.**

If your operating system is Windows, your commands will start with "python" as seen below.
If your OS is Mac or Linux, you will need to start with "python3" instead of "python"


#### Running and setting up without terminal commands

This program can run on a Windows computer with Python installed with little to no use of terminal commands (although terminal will still be used to give you information).  **This is facilitated by having Python available on your *PATH* variable along with PyTk and PIP.** Forgot to enable those? Rerun the installer from above and it will give you the option to modify your installation and fix that.
* Download this program as a zipped archive from GitHub
* Extract all of the files to a convenient location.
* Go to the main folder of this program where you extracted it.  You should see several files including:
  * **zymoResearch.py** (The main executable source code for this system)
  * **SETUP.bat** (Batch script to install required Python packages)
  * **RUN.bat** (Batch script to run the main program)
* Double-click *SETUP.bat*. You should see a terminal window open with some text crossing it and then it will quickly close. This should complete the installation of required Python packages. You should only have to do this before running the program the first time.
* Gather all of your lab information as well as your enrollment letter for CalREDIE, you will need this in the next step.
* Double-click  *RUN.bat*. This will be how you launch the program from here on out.
  * The first time you run, you will get a text editing window for your *config.txt* file.  Fill in as many fields as possible using your lab information or the enrollment letter's credentials.
    * This *config.txt* file will be in the same folder as your executable files, should you need to edit it again.  
    * Please avoid editing this file in Microsoft Word or other word processor programs, as they can introduce strange characters that will corrupt this file. 
    * A simple text editor will avoid this problem and can be launched by starting the program and selecting the *config.txt* file from the main directory.
  * The next time you run this program, you will need to install your certificate.  It should have arrived from CDPH as a file ending with *.pfx* and it should have a password in the enrollment document (please be sure not to confuse this with your SOAP gateway password)
    * Run the program and select the certificate file ending in *.pfx* in the file browser that pops up.
    * A window will pop up asking for the certificate password. Enter the password and either click *ok* or press *Return* to proceed.
      * You can paste the password into the prompt using *ctrl + v* after copying it from the document (recommended)
    * The terminal window should say that the certificate was converted
    * Press enter to end the program
* At this point, setup should be complete. Run the program for submission now and in the future by double-clicking *RUN.bat* as before and selecting a tab-delimited text file (ending in *.txt*) or a comma-separated values (CSV) file ending in *.csv*.  
  * You can also edit your config at any time by selecting your *config.txt* file
    * **Once CalREDIE has approved you for submitting to the production environment**, you will need to edit this file to reflect that. Simply change the *In Testing* value to *FALSE* from its default value of *TRUE* 
  * If your lab is generating raw HL7 data for submission, make sure your HL7 file ends with *.hl7* and select the file containing the HL7 data for upload.  
    * This program will not edit or inspect your HL7 data in any way, other than the very beginning and very end of the block to clean up any potentially unwanted non-printing characters.
* Be sure to check the terminal window after job completion to see any error messages that were generated.  Copies of all data submitted and receipts for data transmission can be found in the *transmissionLogs* folder.

#### Downloading and setting up the program

* You will need to download this program from Github.  If you know how to do this via command line git commands, please use those.
* Otherwise, you will need to click the download link above and download as a zip file.
* Once that is complete, you will want to extract the files to the desired folder.
* With the files extracted, open a command prompt go into the directory containing the zymoTransmit program, you should see a file called "zymoTransmit.py"
* Copy your health department-supplied certificate file (ending in .pfx) to this directory

Install required python packages on Windows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install the required python packages on MacOS or Linux:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Set up your config file and required folders (don't forget to put in userID and password from the document sent by the health department). A file editor window will appear to help with this if GUI functionality is available.

***Remember to save before exiting***

If you need to edit this file in the future, it can be found at ```zymoTransmit/zymoTransmitSupport/config.py``` 
```
python zymoTransmit.py
```
Convert your certificate for use (if you do not supply a file name, a file browser window will appear if GUI functionality is available)
```
python zymoTransmit.py -c [fileName.pfx]
```
Test your connection
```
python zymoTransmit.py -t
```
If the connection worked, you should see something similar to:
```
Server returned:

Prefixes:
     xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
     ns0: urn:cdc:iisb:2011

Global elements:

     ns0:MessageTooLargeFault(ns0:MessageTooLargeFaultType)
     ns0:SecurityFault(ns0:SecurityFaultType)
     ns0:UnsupportedOperationFault(ns0:UnsupportedOperationFaultType)
     ns0:connectivityTest(ns0:connectivityTestRequestType)
     ns0:connectivityTestResponse(ns0:connectivityTestResponseType)
     ns0:fault(ns0:soapFaultType)
     ns0:submitMessage(ns0:submitMessageRequestType)
     ns0:submitMessageResponse(ns0:submitMessageResponseType)
...
```
If you see an exception, please check your Internet connection and try again or reach out for support.  

If this works, you are ready to transmit!


#### Preparing a report
The program should have come packaged with a file called ```templateSubmission.txt``` this tab-delimited text file will open in Microsoft Excel and can help you start putting together reports for submission.  Please try to fill in all fields if possible to avoid having submissions rejected for missing data.  Fields that can accept telephone numbers can also accept emails if that is the preferred method of contact for the patient or provider.  

To find out an appropriate LOINC code to describe your test:
```
python zymoTransmit.py -l
```
To find out an appropriate SNOMED code to describe your specimen:
```
python zymoTransmit.py -s
```
There are several codes related to SARS-CoV-2 testing available, so please look carefully for the one that most closely describes your test method and sample.


#### Transmitting results
Once a report has been filled out correctly, submitting reports requires a simple command:
```
python zymoTransmit.py [reportName.txt]
```
Use the file name for your report in place of the bracketed text above. 

If you are unsure how to find the file, leave it blank and a file browser window will open on your screen to help you find it if GUI functionality is available.

#### Command line arguments
Commands are formulated as follows:
```
python zymoTransmit.py [argument] [filename if needed]
```

| Long Name        | Short Name           | Notes  
| --------------- |:--------------:|:--------|
--help	|	-h	|	Displays a list of arguments 
--convertCertificate	|	-c	|	Loads and converts a certificate. Requires a file and will prompt for one if missing. May ask for certificate password.
--editConfig	|	-e	|	Edit the configuration file.  ***Remember to save and exit with done***
--testConnection	|	-t	|	Tests the connection to the health department, run as a final step of setup
--snomed	|	-s	|	Display relevant SNOMED codes for specimen types
--loinc	|	-l	|	Display relevant LOINC codes for testing types


## OUTPUT
All outputs will be written to the designated output folder for the container, which will unmount upon completion of the run.

There will be two primary output files, one report in HTML format and one in JSON format.  Examples of these can be seen [here for HTML](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/miqScoreShotgunPublic/blob/master/exampleReport.html) and [here for JSON](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/miqScoreShotgunPublic/blob/master/exampleReport.json).  The HTML report is designed to be viewed in a browser and gives an overview of the results for the sample.  The JSON report, while human-readable, is designed primarily to facilitate analysis using an automated script.  It also provides much more detailed information on the results than the HTML report.  
In addition to the two primary files, there will be a log file that can be used in the event of a problem with analysis for additional information on the run.  Finally, there will be several files generated by the DADA2 pipeline.  If you are familiar with DADA2, you will be familiar with these outputs.
